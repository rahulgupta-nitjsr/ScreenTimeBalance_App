# ZenScreen

A mobile app that helps users earn screen time through positive habit building, using a science-based algorithm and thoughtful design.

> *Transforming screen time guilt into positive habit building through gamification and behavioral science.*

## Project Overview

ZenScreen is a mobile app that allows users to **earn screen time** through positive habit building. Instead of restricting phone usage, the app motivates users to engage in healthy activities (sleep, exercise, outdoor time, productive work) to unlock screen time rewards using a science-backed algorithm.

**Key Innovation:** Positive reinforcement over punishment - users are empowered, not restricted.

## Algorithm & Gamification

### Science-Based Earning System
The app uses a transparent, research-backed algorithm to convert healthy habits into screen time:

```
ðŸŒ™ Sleep: 1 hour = 25 min screen time (optimal: 7-9 hours)
ðŸ’ª Exercise: 1 hour = 20 min screen time (max: 2 hours/day)
ðŸŒ³ Outdoor: 1 hour = 15 min screen time (max: 2 hours/day)
ðŸ“š Productive: 1 hour = 10 min screen time (max: 4 hours/day)
```

### POWER+ Mode
Users can unlock 30 bonus minutes by achieving 3 of 4 daily health goals
- Creates motivation through achievement
- Celebrates positive behavior
- Encourages consistent habit formation

### Behavioral Design
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Rewards over restrictions
- **Transparency**: Clear earning rates and algorithm explanation
- **Flexibility**: Manual entry + timer options
- **Honest Tracking**: Prevents gaming through smart constraints
