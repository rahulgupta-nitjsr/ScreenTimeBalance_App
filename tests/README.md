### **🚨 CRITICAL: Test Directory Usage Rules**

**ALWAYS use these established test directories:**
- ✅ **Flutter Tests**: `ScreenTimeBalance\tests\flutter\`
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: `ScreenTimeBalance\tests\flutter\unit\`
- ✅ **Widget Tests**: `ScreenTimeBalance\tests\flutter\widget\`
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: `ScreenTimeBalance\tests\flutter\integration\`
- ✅ **Test Mocks**: `ScreenTimeBalance\tests\flutter\mocks\`

**❌ NEVER create new test folders** - Always use the existing structure and place test artifacts in the designated locations.

## 🎯 Feature-Based Testing Workflow

### **Testing Philosophy**
- **Feature-Driven Testing**: Test each feature completely before moving to the next
- **Automated Testing First**: All tests must be automated with no manual testing
- **Testing-Driven Development**: Tests must pass before proceeding to next feature
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each feature requires 10+ test scenarios with 90% coverage

### **Testing Process Flow**

#### **Phase 1: Pre-Development Testing Setup**
1. **Test Framework Setup**: Complete testing infrastructure
2. **Test Cases Documentation**: All 180 test cases documented
3. **Test Data Preparation**: Comprehensive test data sets
4. **Environment Configuration**: All test environments configured
5. **Dashboard Setup**: Real-time testing progress tracking

#### **Phase 2: Feature-Based Testing Execution**

**For Each Feature (Sequential Order):**

1. **Feature Development Start**
   - Development team begins feature implementation
   - Test cases ready and documented
   - Test environment prepared

2. **Test Execution**
   - Run all 10 test cases for the feature
   - Execute automated tests (unit, widget, integration)
   - Monitor performance and security tests
   - Record all results in dashboard

3. **Test Results Analysis**
   - Analyze pass/fail results
   - Generate failure reports for failed tests
   - Update dashboard with progress
   - Document defects and issues

4. **Quality Gate Check**
   - Verify 90% test coverage achieved
   - Confirm all critical tests pass
   - Validate performance benchmarks met
   - Check security and compliance requirements

5. **Feature Completion Decision**
   - **If All Tests Pass**: Mark feature complete, proceed to next
   - **If Tests Fail**: Fix issues, re-test until all pass
   - **If Quality Gates Not Met**: Address gaps before proceeding

6. **Documentation Update**
   - Update test cases with actual results
   - Update dashboard with completion status
   - Archive failure reports if resolved
   - Prepare for next feature testing

#### **Phase 3: Non-Functional Testing**

**After All Features Complete:**
1. **Performance Testing**: Full app performance validation
2. **Security Testing**: Comprehensive security assessment
3. **Compliance Testing**: GDPR, accessibility, platform guidelines
4. **Fairness Testing**: Algorithm bias and demographic fairness

## Release 1.2 Testing Notes — Device Screen Time Used (Android-first)

### Scope
- Validate Android Used time retrieval via Usage Access, permission flows, persistence, and UI display of Earned/Used/Remaining.

### Execution Guidance
- Use Android emulator/device with Usage Access toggled to test both education and granted flows.
- Measure fetch latency (target < 2s) and UI update latency (target < 100ms).
- Confirm fallback messaging on unsupported/OEM-restricted devices.

### Related Artifacts
- Test cases: TC181–TC190 in `tests/test-cases.md`.
- Docs: PRD §11 (Release 1.2), Features “Feature 17,” Architecture (ScreenTimeService pipeline), Implementation Plan (R1.2), Testing Plan addendum.
