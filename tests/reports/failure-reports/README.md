# Failure Reports Directory - ZenScreen Mobile App

**Last Updated**: September 11, 2025  
**Directory Purpose**: Individual test failure reports only  

---

## 📁 Directory Purpose

This directory contains **individual failure reports** generated only when test cases fail. No success reports are stored here - only actionable failure analysis.

### **🚨 CRITICAL: Test Directory Structure**

**ALWAYS use these established test directories:**
- ✅ **Flutter Tests**: `ScreenTimeBalance\tests\flutter\`
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: `ScreenTimeBalance\tests\flutter\unit\`
- ✅ **Widget Tests**: `ScreenTimeBalance\tests\flutter\widget\`
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: `ScreenTimeBalance\tests\flutter\integration\`
- ✅ **Test Mocks**: `ScreenTimeBalance\tests\flutter\mocks\`

**❌ NEVER create new test folders** - Always use the existing structure and place test artifacts in the designated locations.

## 📈 Failure Analysis

### **Common Failure Patterns**
- **Functional Failures**: Logic errors, incorrect calculations
- **Performance Failures**: Slow response times, memory leaks
- **Security Failures**: Authentication issues, data exposure
- **Compliance Failures**: Accessibility violations, privacy issues
- **Fairness Failures**: Algorithm bias, unequal treatment

### **Failure Trends**
- **Feature-Specific**: Track which features have most failures
- **Environment-Specific**: Track failures by device/OS
- **Time-Based**: Track failure patterns over time
- **Severity Distribution**: Track failure severity levels
