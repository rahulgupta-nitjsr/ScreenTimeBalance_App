### 🔑 **Key Flutter Project Concepts**

#### **1. Unified Codebase in `lib/` Folder**
- **Most code goes in `lib/`** and runs on ALL platforms
- **Platform-specific folders** (`android/`, `ios/`, `windows/`) are for configuration only
- **Single source of truth** for your app logic

#### **2. Platform-Specific Configuration**
- **`android/`**: Android permissions, build config, native code
- **`ios/`**: iOS permissions, build config, native code  
- **`windows/`**: Windows-specific configurations
- **`pubspec.yaml`**: Dependencies, assets, app metadata

#### **3. Flutter Development Workflow**
```bash
# Create new Flutter project
flutter create project_name

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on emulator/device
flutter run

# Hot reload (instant changes)
r

# Hot restart (full restart)
R

# Build for production
flutter build apk --release
```

### 🎯 **Key Files Explained**

| File/Folder | Purpose | What Goes Here |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **lib/main.dart** | App entry point | App initialization, routing |
| **lib/screens/** | App screens | Each of your 6 screens |
| **lib/widgets/** | Reusable components | Buttons, cards, progress bars |
| **lib/models/** | Data structures | User, habits, timer data |
| **lib/services/** | Business logic | Database, auth, algorithm |
| **lib/utils/** | Helper functions | Constants, utility functions |
| **android/** | Android-specific | Permissions, configurations |
| **test/** | Automated tests | Unit, widget, integration tests |
| **pubspec.yaml** | Dependencies | Packages, assets, metadata |

## 📚 **Key Takeaways**

### **What Makes Mobile Development Different**
- **Cross-Platform Frameworks**: Flutter allows single codebase for multiple platforms
- **Device Testing**: Real device testing is essential for mobile apps
- **App Store Deployment**: Different from web deployment (approval process, store policies)
- **Platform Guidelines**: Follow Material Design (Android) and Human Interface Guidelines (iOS)
- **Performance Considerations**: Battery usage, memory management, network optimization

### **Success Factors**
- **Documentation-First**: Comprehensive planning before development
- **Design-Driven**: Complete design system before coding
- **Testing-Integrated**: Automated testing throughout development
- **User-Focused**: Always consider the end user experience
- **Quality Gates**: Don't proceed until current work is complete
