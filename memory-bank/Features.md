## 9. Iteration 8: Advanced Features

**Goal**: Polish and advanced functionality

### Feature 15: Data Correction & Audit Trail

**Purpose**: Allow users to correct accidental entries while maintaining behavioral integrity.

**User Story**: As a user, I want to correct accidental habit entries, so that my data is accurate, but not so easily that I can game the system.

**Functional Requirements**:
- Edit habit times within same day only
- Undo last action within 5 minutes
- Confirmation dialog for significant changes (>30 min adjustments)
- Audit trail of all corrections
- Visual indication of edited entries
- Reason logging for significant changes
- Maximum edit limits per day

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a user makes an accidental entry
- When they attempt to correct it within the same day
- Then they can edit the time with confirmation
- And the change is logged in audit trail
- And earned screen time recalculates immediately
- And edit limits are enforced

**Technical Requirements**:
- Time-limited edit windows
- Audit logging for all changes
- Confirmation dialogs for large adjustments
- Real-time algorithm recalculation
- Change history storage
- Data integrity validation
- Security measures for audit data

**Automated Testing Requirements**:
- **Unit Tests**: Edit logic, audit trail, validation rules
- **Widget Tests**: Edit UI, confirmation dialogs
- **Integration Tests**: Complete edit flow
- **Security Tests**: Audit data protection
- **Performance Tests**: Edit response times

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Same-day edits work correctly
2. Edit limits are enforced
3. Audit trail logs all changes
4. Confirmation dialogs appear for large changes
5. Earned time recalculates after edits
6. Visual indicators show edited entries
7. Reason logging works for significant changes
8. Data integrity is maintained
9. Security measures protect audit data
10. Performance is maintained during edits

**Edge Cases**:
- User attempts to edit yesterday's data → Show "Can only edit today's habits" message
- Excessive editing attempts → Show "Maximum edits reached" with explanation
- Edit during active timer → Prevent editing of actively timed category
- Edit that would change POWER+ Mode status → Show impact preview before confirmation
- Audit data corruption → Recover gracefully

### Feature 16: Error Handling & Recovery

**Purpose**: Gracefully handle errors and provide recovery mechanisms.

**User Story**: As a user, I want the app to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue using it even when something goes wrong.

**Functional Requirements**:
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic error recovery where possible
- Data backup before risky operations
- Crash reporting (anonymous)
- Graceful degradation of features
- Network error handling
- Database error recovery
- Performance monitoring

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given an error occurs in the app
- When the user encounters it
- Then they see a helpful error message
- And the app attempts automatic recovery
- And core functionality remains available
- And errors are logged for improvement

**Technical Requirements**:
- Comprehensive error logging
- Automatic backup mechanisms
- Fallback strategies for each feature
- User feedback collection for errors
- Recovery procedures documentation
- Performance monitoring
- Network resilience

**Automated Testing Requirements**:
- **Unit Tests**: Error handling logic, recovery mechanisms
- **Widget Tests**: Error UI, user feedback
- **Integration Tests**: Error scenarios, recovery flows
- **Performance Tests**: Error impact on performance
- **Reliability Tests**: System resilience

**Test Scenarios**:
1. Network errors are handled gracefully
2. Database errors recover automatically
3. User-friendly error messages are displayed
4. Core functionality remains available during errors
5. Automatic recovery works when possible
6. Error logging captures necessary information
7. Performance monitoring detects issues
8. User feedback is collected appropriately
9. Recovery procedures work correctly
10. System resilience is maintained

**Edge Cases**:
- Complete network failure → Offline mode continues
- Database corruption → Automatic recovery from backup
- Memory pressure → Graceful feature degradation
- App crashes → Recovery on restart
- Data corruption → Validation and recovery

## 10. Automated Testing Framework

### Testing Philosophy
Every feature must have comprehensive automated tests before implementation. Testing is not an afterthought but a core part of the development process.

### Testing Types
- **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and algorithms
- **Widget Tests**: UI components and interactions
- **Integration Tests**: Complete user flows
- **Performance Tests**: Speed and memory usage
- **Accessibility Tests**: Screen reader and accessibility compliance
- **Security Tests**: Data protection and access control

### Testing Requirements Per Feature
1. **Test Cases**: Minimum 10 test scenarios per feature
2. **Edge Cases**: All documented edge cases must be tested
3. **Performance**: Response times and memory usage benchmarks
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance testing
5. **Cross-Platform**: Android-specific testing with iOS compatibility checks

### Automated Testing Pipeline
- **Pre-commit**: Run unit and widget tests
- **Feature Complete**: Run full test suite including integration tests
- **Pre-release**: Performance and accessibility testing
- **Continuous**: Automated testing on multiple device configurations

### Quality Gates
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 90% test coverage
- **Performance**: Response times < 100ms for UI interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Security**: No sensitive data exposure
- **Cross-Platform**: iOS compatibility verified

## 11. Cross-Platform Development Strategy

### Android-First Approach
- **Primary Platform**: Android development and testing
- **Flutter Framework**: Single codebase for both platforms
- **Material Design**: Android-first UI components
- **Platform-Specific**: Android permissions and features

### iOS-Ready Architecture
- **Responsive Design**: Layouts that work on iOS screen sizes
- **Component Abstraction**: UI components that adapt to platform
- **Platform Detection**: Code that handles platform differences
- **Future Migration**: Minimal changes needed for iOS release

### Technical Considerations
- **State Management**: Provider/Riverpod for cross-platform state
- **Navigation**: Flutter Navigator 2.0 for consistent navigation
- **Database**: SQLite with sqflite package
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth for cross-platform auth
- **Performance**: Optimized for both platforms
